56,Resources and Evaluation,time-stamped Greek corpus,"Our corpus comes from two sources: i) Project Gutenberg, a library with over 60,000 free e-books from all over the world, offered in various digital formats, including plain text, EPUB, kindle and HTML, and ii) Open Library, an online library with more than 7,000 Greek e-books, most of which are in PDF format. [...] As we focus on the latest form of the Greek language, we had to filter books that were published before 1970. Each book entry of Open Library contains a specific text field that is referencing the publication date of the book. Hence, extracting the publication date for this source was quite easy. However, Project Gutenberg does not contain the publication year of the book among its metadata. We, therefore, had to parse the downloaded text files, examine the structure of many books and develop appropriate techniques for extracting the book’s published date. Since many of its books were from the late decades of the 18th century or the dawn of 19th, they had a similar pattern for the covers’ structure that usually contained the publisher’s location and year of publication among the other data.",https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/greek-words-evolution.git,created,corpus,raw,monolingual,TXT,https://opensource.org/license/mit/,Yes,downloadable,accessible,"https://www.openbook.gr/ , https://www.gutenberg.org/",literature,<1800,2020

Due to the nature of the dataset, it has been used extensively to train, test and develop NER and IC networks and question answering systems, for both spoken and written language. As the dataset consists of audio recordings and their corresponding manual transcripts and every utterance is completely labelled, it is convenient for both types of approaches. The English ATIS dataset is a modified version where 1290 duplicate utterances have been removed resulting in a clean version which consists of 5473 unique sentences. This processed version has been translated in Greek language. For the translation we harvested the textual data of ATIS and we translated it to Greek employing a panel of 5 persons in order to optimize the quality of the translation.

We decided to use the keywords “Κορονοιος,” “κορονοιός,” “κορωνοιος,” “Κορωνοϊός,” “Κορωνοιος,” all different forms of coronavirus with the same meaning in Greek (COVID-19) but with different orthography. All these key words were transformed using percent spelling to overcome the software’s inability to use non-Western character sets. Twitter’s API allows us to query a maximum of 20,000 tweets. In our case, we performed the search in four different time periods, creating four sets of approximately 20,000 tweets. In all cases, the time span covered about seven to ten days into the past, starting from the day of the search. The fact that in all cases the search was aborted due to the limitation of the API proves that quite a large volume of views and opinions were circulated.

For each language there is a set of problems, where one problem comprises a set of documents of known authorship by the same author and exactly one document of questioned authorship. All the documents within a problem are in the same language and placed in a separate folder. The language information was encoded in the problem label (i.e., folder name) so that it is possible to apply appropriate models per language without the need of language identification techniques. [...] The Greek part of the corpus comprises newspaper articles published in the Greek weekly newspaper TO BHMA2 from 1996 to 2012. Initially, a pool of more than 800 opinion articles by about 100 authors was downloaded. The length of each article is at least 1,000 words. All HTML tags, scripts etc. as well as the title/subtitles of the article and author names were removed semi-automatically. Based on this collection of documents, a set of author verification problems was formed. In each problem, we included texts that had strong thematic similarities indicated by the occurrence of certain keywords. In addition, to make the task more challenging, we applied a stylometric analysis based on a character 3-gram representation and the dissimilarity measure d1 proposed in [32] to detect stylistically similar or dissimilar documents. Hence, in problems where the true answer is positive (the questioned document was written by the author of the known documents) the unknown document was selected to have relatively high dissimilarity from the other known documents. On the other hand, in problems where the true answer is negative the unknown document (by a certain author) was selected to have relatively low dissimilarity from the known documents (by another author). Therefore, beyond similarities in genre, theme, and date of writing, there also stylistic relationships in within-problem documents of the Greek sub-corpus. This makes the Greek part of the evaluation corpus more challenging especially for verification methods based on CNG and variants [33].

It contains 638,865 tokens (43,025 types), which are distributed per Parliamentary period as follows: ΙΓ’ (13th) Period: 121,103 tokens (16,238 types), IE’ (15th) Period: 173,741 tokens (21,378 types), ΙΣΤ’ (16th) Period: 181,147 tokens (21,668 types), IZ’ (17th) Period: 162,874 tokens (21,409 types). For each text file in the corpus that corresponds to a single written question, there is a rich set of metadata that have been recorded and stored in an external database in csv format.

723,authorship analysis,,"For the needs of our research we developed a corpus which was controlled simultaneously for the author’s gender, text topic, genre and medium. More specifically the corpus design was based on the following premises: 1) Equal number of texts (50) written by male and female authors.2) Each text from a male author with specific topic and genre should be matched by a text in the same topic and genre from a female author. 3) All texts should be published in the same newspaper (Eleftherotypia) in a brief time span (1 year). 4) The collected texts should belong to many different and distinct topics and genres in order to represent a wide socio-pragmatic space of language usage. The resulting corpus contains 700 texts equally divided in 7 male and 7 female authors. Although, there are some small differences between specific topic and genre categories in spite of the strict sampling restrictions described above, the corpus should be considered balanced. The texts were obtained using “Minotauros” a tool for creating corpora from web sources (Koutsis, Kouklakis, Mikros, & Markopoulos, 2005). Tokenization and Part of Speech tagging was performed by ‘Ellogon’ a multi-lingual, cross-platform, general-purpose language engineering environment, developed from the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, NCSR ""Demokritos"" (Petasis, Karkaletsis, Paliouras, Androutsopoulos, & Spyropoulos, 2002). Measurements of various stylometric variables were made using “Corpus Manager” (Kouklakis, Mikros, Markopoulos, & Koutsis, 2007) as well as specialized PERL scripts.",n/a,created,corpus,annotated,monolingual,n/a,n/a,No,n/a,not accessible,https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/855995/izrl31kmfz52myo.pdf?1425072791=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DMINOTAVROS_A_tool_for_the_semi_automated.pdf&Expires=1708977338&Signature=T0hVEa8JUYG0iw~pANSa8YInDfo8MFfrTMk4UeVDt7uIIHUBS9hlwTx4fqOsTtMsJp~ubxXXl7p6bn78gWPXygJgjmuiegDficUfDIqhTDsQRRBmy9XvERzIER5TnqTR5PsW5vsEQaPMatly1jOM-xXxjGU4bZEKrLlq42Jol7oIuDw-Dnpa77xm-6D-LTlXuqxKhyxS4Cv2YgokRDIxV7NVe7WcTLTkDVjD-QFrs4nPU6kNBoBzmBCG6tN4ETr9yilJVqwWM3xL9DZQyA1uWwjE7N7V0wKOFQw9OxGYTtxxPX4UoLbJcQv0GhOt6xUnUlPYRecG0RJbxSR3oZFbsg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA,"science, society, economy, art",,
724,authorship analysis,Greek Blog Corpus,"In order to explore authorship attribution and gender identification in Greek blogs we had to develop from scratch a Greek blog corpus (GBC). For this reason we harvested the Greek blogosphere from September 2010 till August 2011 and manually collected 100 Greek blogs equally divided to 50 male and 50 female bloggers. Since topic can induce significant bias into stylometric measurements [29], we decided to explore only a part of the collected corpus, using blogs that share the same topic. In this study we used 20 blogs (10 male and 10 female authors) with a common topic (Personal affairs), with a total of 1,000 blog posts counting 406,460 words. For each author we collected the 50 most recent blog posts.",n/a,created,corpus,raw,monolingual,n/a,n/a,No,n/a,not accessible,n/a,n/a,September 2010,August 2011
