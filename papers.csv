55;Greek-Bert: The Greeks Visiting Sesame Street;"""©"" 2020 ACM.Transformer-based language models, such as BERT and its variants, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks on generic benchmark datasets (e.g., GLUE, SQUAD, RACE). However, these models have mostly been applied to the resource-rich English language. In this paper, we present GREEK-BERT, a monolingual BERT -based language model for modern Greek. We evaluate its performance in three NLP tasks, i.e., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and natural language inference, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Interestingly, in two of the benchmarks GREEK-BERT outperforms two multilingual Transformer-based models (M-BERT, XLM-R), as well as shallower neural baselines operating on pre-trained word embeddings, by a large margin (5%-10%). Most importantly, we make both GREEK-BERT and our training code publicly available, along with code illustrating how GREEK-BERT can be fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks.

78;Design And Construction Of The Greek Grammar Checker;"""©"" The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EADH. All rights reserved.The aim of this paper is to present both the main parts of the designing and the implementation of a useful and user-friendly electronic tool, the Greek grammar checker. This tool carries out the function of analyzing morphologically and syntactically sentences, phrases, and words in order to correct syntactic, grammatical, and stylistic errors (Iordanidou, 1999, 2004). Our premise in order to deal with all these issues is the settings of Grammar (adaptation of Little Modern Grammar of Manolis Triantafyllidis), which is the formal grammatical codification of Modern Greek, since 1976 (Triantafyllidis, 1991). This paper also presents the formalism used (the Mnemosyne), a formalism that handles with the particularities of the Greek language that hinder the computational processing. This formalism has already been used to identify multi-word terms and to phrase grammars, aiming to automatically extract information. We tested the Greek grammar checker by giving texts that were to be evaluated both to the grammar checker and to a person. In the majority of cases, the human corrector accuracy is almost equal to the grammar checker one. As far as mistakes that have to do with the coherence of the text or with meaning are concerned, the human corrector was the only accurate corrector, not the grammar checker one (Gakis, 2015).";Digital Scholarship in the Humanities;1/9/2017;2017;https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqw025;Panagiotis Gakis, Chris T.

81;A Novel, Gradient Boosting Framework For Sentiment Analysis In Languages Where Nlp Resources Are Not Plentiful: A Case Study For Modern Greek;"""©"" 2016 by the authors.Sentiment analysis has played a primary role in text classification. It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier. Accordingly, we apply gradient boosting machines, an ensemble algorithm that can learn with different loss functions providing the ability to work efficiently with high dimensional data. Moreover, for the task at hand, we deal with a class imbalance issues since the distribution of sentiments in real-world applications often displays issues of inequality. For example, in political forums or electronic discussions about immigration or religion, negative comments overwhelm the positive ones. The class imbalance problem was confronted using a hybrid technique that performs a variation of under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class, respectively. Experimental results, considering different settings, such as translation of tokens against translation of sentences, consideration of limited Greek text preprocessing and omission of the translation phase, demonstrated that the proposed gradient boosting framework can effectively cope with both high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets and performs significantly better than a plethora of traditional machine learning classification approaches in terms of precision and recall measures.";Algorithms;1/3/2017;2017;https://doi.org/10.3390/a10010034;Vasileios Athanasiou, Manolis Maragoudakis;33;43;Scopus, Semantic Scholar;TITLE-ABS({Modern Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Modern+Greek+Natural+Language+Processing, TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Greek+Natural+Language+Processing;31/10/2022, 01/11/2022, 26/11/2022;Journal;Article, Article, 'JournalArticle';Document-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;['Computer Science'];[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}];"gradient boosting machines; sentiment analysis; high-dimensional data; Modern Greek";Modern Greek;1

140;How To Detect Online Hate Towards Migrants And Refugees? Developing And Evaluating A Classifier Of Racist And Xenophobic Hate Speech Using Shallow And Deep Learning;"""©"" 2022 by the authors.Hate speech spreading online is a matter of growing concern since social media allows for its rapid, uncontrolled, and massive dissemination. For this reason, several researchers are already working on the development of prototypes that allow for the detection of cyberhate automatically and on a large scale. However, most of them are developed to detect hate only in English, and very few focus specifically on racism and xenophobia, the category of discrimination in which the most hate crimes are recorded each year. In addition, ad hoc datasets manually generated by several trained coders are rarely used in the development of these prototypes since almost all researchers use already available datasets. The objective of this research is to overcome the limitations of those previous works by developing and evaluating classification models capable of detecting racist and/or xenophobic hate speech being spread online, first in Spanish, and later in Greek and Italian. In the development of these prototypes, three differentiated machine learning strategies are tested. First, various traditional shallow learning algorithms are used. Second, deep learning is used, specifically, an ad hoc developed RNN model. Finally, a BERT-based model is developed in which transformers and neural networks are used. The results confirm that deep learning strategies perform better in detecting anti-immigration hate speech online. It is for this reason that the deep architectures were the ones finally improved and tested for hate speech detection in Greek and Italian and in multisource. The results of this study represent an advance in the scientific literature in this field of research, since up to now, no online anti-immigration hate detectors had been tested in these languages and using this type of deep architecture.";Sustainability (Switzerland);1/10/2022;2022;https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013094;Carlos Arcila Calder?n, Javier J.

157;Dimsum: Distributed And Multilingual Summarization Of Financial Narratives;This paper was submitted for Financial Narrative Summarization (FNS) task in FNP-2022 workshop. The objective of the task was to generate not more than 1000 words summaries for the annual financial reports written in English, Spanish and Greek languages. The central idea of this paper is to demonstrate automatic ways of identifying key narrative sections and their contributions towards generating summaries of financial reports. We have observed a few limitations in the previous works: First, the complete report was being considered for summary generation instead of key narrative sections. Second, many of the works followed manual or heuristic-based techniques to identify narrative sections. Third, sentences from key narrative sections were abruptly dropped to limit the summary to the desired length. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduced a novel approach to automatically learn key narrative sections and their weighted contributions to the reports. Since the summaries may come from various parts of the reports, the summary generation process was distributed amongst the key narrative sections based on the weights identified, later combined to have an overall summary. We also showcased that our approach is adaptive to various report formats and languages.;Proceedings of the 4th Financial Narrative Processing Workshop @LREC2022;Éïõí-22;2022;https://aclanthology.org/2022.fnp-1.9;Neelesh Shukla, Amit Vaid, Raghu Katikeri, Sangeeth Keeriyadath, Msp Raja;1;1;ACL;Greek;26/11/2022;;;Summarization;Summarization;;;distributed, financial, narrative, summarization, multilingual;Modern Greek, English, Spanish;2

In particular, we created a new Encoder-Decoder architecture in Spanish, MariMari, based on an existing Encoding-only model; we also trained multilingual Encoder-Decoder models for this task. Finally, the summaries for the reports in Greek were obtained with a translation-summary-translation system in which the reports were translated to English and summarised, and then the summaries were translated back to Greek.";Proceedings of the 4th Financial Narrative Processing Workshop @LREC2022;Éïõí-22;2022;https://aclanthology.org/2022.fnp-1.8;Alejandro Vaca, Alba Segurado, David Betancur, ?lvaro Barbero Jim?nez;1;1;ACL;Greek;26/11/2022;;;Summarization;Summarization;;;Extractive Summarization, Abstractive Summarization, Multilingual Models, Encoder-Decoder;Modern Greek, English, Spanish;2

169;Multimodal Classification Of Safety-Report Observations;"""©"" 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Modern businesses are obligated to conform to regulations to prevent physical injuries and ill health for anyone present on a site under their responsibility, such as customers, employees and visitors. Safety officers (SOs) are engineers, who perform site audits to businesses, record observations regarding possible safety issues and make appropriate recommendations. In this work, we develop a multimodal machine-learning architecture for the analysis and categorization of safety observations, given textual descriptions and images taken from the location sites. For this, we utilize a new multimodal dataset, Safety4All, which contains 5344 safety-related observations created by 86 SOs in 486 sites. An observation consists of a short issue description, written by the SOs, accompanied with images where the issue is shown, relevant metadata and a priority score. Our proposed architecture is based on the joint fine tuning of large pretrained language and image neural network models. Specifically, we propose the use of a joint task and contrastive loss, which aligns the text and vision representations in a joint multimodal space. The contrastive loss ensures that inter-modality representation distances are maintained, so that vision and language representations for similar samples are close in the shared multimodal space. We evaluate the proposed model on three tasks, namely, priority classification of input observations, observation assessment and observation categorization. Our experiments show that inspection scene images and textual descriptions provide complementary information, signifying the importance of both modalities. Furthermore, the use of the joint contrastive loss produces strong multimodal representations and outperforms a baseline simple model in tasks fusion. In addition, we train and release a large transformer-based language model for the Greek language based on the Electra architecture.";Applied Sciences (Switzerland);1/6/2022;2022;https://doi.org/10.3390/app12125781;Georgios Paraskevopoulos, Petros Pistofidis, Georgios Banoutsos, Efthymios Georgiou, V.

In its simplest form, sentiment analysis deals with the polarity of a given text, i.e., whether the opinion expressed in it is positive or negative. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining applications on websites and the social media range from product reviews and brand reception to political issues and the stock market. The vast majority of the research in sentiment analysis has mostly dealt with English data, where there’s an abundance of readily available and annotated for sentiment corpora. With a few notable exceptions, the research in other minor languages such as Greek is lacking. This paper deals with sentiment analysis of electronic product reviews written in Greek. To this end, a small dataset of 480 positive and negative reviews is compiled and used, taken from the popular Greek e-commerce website, www.skroutz.gr. Different computational models for training and testing the dataset are evaluated, ranging from simple Naive Bayes with n-gram features to state-of-the-art BERT. The results look very promising for such a small corpus.";Journal of Quantitative Linguistics;1/1/2022;2022;https://doi.org/10.1080/09296174.2021.1885872;Dimitris Bilianos;0;2;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Document-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;;n/a;Modern Greek;2
193;Multilingual Offensive Language Identification For Low-Resource Languages;"""©"" 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.Offensive content is pervasive in social media and a reason for concern to companies and government organizations. Several studies have been recently published investigating methods to detect the various forms of such content (e.g., hate speech, cyberbullying, and cyberaggression). The clear majority of these studies deal with English partially because most annotated datasets available contain English data. In this article, we take advantage of available English datasets by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and transfer learning to make predictions in low-resource languages. We project predictions on comparable data in Arabic, Bengali, Danish, Greek, Hindi, Spanish, and Turkish. We report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali in TRAC-2 shared task [23], 0.8532 F1 macro for Danish and 0.8701 F1 macro for Greek in OffensEval 2020 [58], 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi in HASOC 2019 shared task [27], and 0.7513 F1 macro for Spanish in in SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval) [7], showing that our approach compares favorably to the best systems submitted to recent shared tasks on these three languages.

Vaccines are considered the main available weapon at hand to mitigate the spread. As a result, the development of efficient systems to understand and supervise the information dissemination, as well as the evolution of sentiments towards vaccines is critical. The goal of this research was to build and apply a supervised learning approach to monitor the dynamics of public opinion on COVID-19 vaccines using Twitter data. 1,394,535 and 61,077 tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, respectively in English and Greek, were collected, classified based on sentiment polarity and analyzed over time to gain insights into sentiment trends. Our findings reveal that overall negative, neutral, and positive sentiments were at 36.5%, 39.9%, and 23.6% in the English language dataset, respectively, whereas overall negative and non-negative sentiments were at 60.1% and 39.9% in the Greek language dataset. Policymakers and health experts could take into consideration social media sentiment analysis alongside other ways of evaluating public sentiment.

197;Soundexgr: An Algorithm For Phonetic Matching For The Greek Language;"""©"" The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.Text usually suffers from typos which can negatively affect various Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing tasks. Although there is a wide variety of choices for tackling this issue in the English language, this is not the case for other languages. For the Greek language, most of the existing phonetic algorithms provide rather insufficient support. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce an algorithm for phonetic matching designed for the Greek language: we start from the original Soundex and we redesign and extend it for accommodating the Greek language's phonetic rules, ending up to a family of algorithms, that we call <![CDATA[ ${\tt Soundex}_{GR}$ ]]>. Then, we report various experimental results showcasing how the algorithm behaves in different scenarios, and we provide comparative results for various parameters of the algorithm for revealing the trade-off between precision and recall in datasets with different kinds of errors. We also provide comparative results with matching using stemming, full phonemic transcription, and edit distance, that demonstrate that <![CDATA[ ${\tt Soundex}_{GR}$ ]]> performs better (indicatively, it achieves F-Score over 95% in collections of similar-sounded words). The simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm make it applicable and adaptable to a wide range of tasks.";Natural Language Engineering;1/1/2022;2022;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324922000018;Antrei Kavros, Yannis Tzitzikas;1;1;Scopus, Semantic Scholar;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Greek+Natural+Language+Processing;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Grammatical Error Correction;Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing;;[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}];"Phonetic algorithms; Greek language; Phonetic matching; Phonemic matching";Modern Greek;2
198;Upon Improving The Performance Of Localized Healthcare Virtual Assistants;"""©"" 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Virtual assistants are becoming popular in a variety of domains, responsible for automating repetitive tasks or allowing users to seamlessly access useful information. With the advances in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, there has been an increasing interest in applying such assistants in new areas and with new capabilities. In particular, their application in e-healthcare is becoming attractive and is driven by the need to access medically-related knowledge, as well as providing first-level assistance in an efficient manner. In such types of virtual assistants, localization is of utmost importance, since the general population (especially the aging population) is not familiar with the needed “healthcare vocabulary” to communicate facts properly; and state-of-practice proves relatively poor in performance when it comes to specialized virtual assistants for less frequently spoken languages. In this context, we present a Greek ML-based virtual assistant specifically designed to address some commonly occurring tasks in the healthcare domain, such as doctor’s appointments or distress (panic situations) management. We build on top of an existing open-source framework, discuss the necessary modifications needed to address the language-specific characteristics and evaluate various combinations of word embeddings and machine learning models to enhance the assistant’s behaviour. Results show that we are able to build an efficient Greek-speaking virtual assistant to support e-healthcare, while the NLP pipeline proposed can be applied in other (less frequently spoken) languages, without loss of generality.";Healthcare (Switzerland);1/1/2022;2022;https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010099;Nikolaos Malamas, Konstantinos Papangelou, Andreas L.

201;Modeling Multiple Language Learning In A Developmental Cognitive Architecture;"""©"" 2016 IEEE.In this work, we model multiple natural language learning in a developmental neuroscience-inspired architecture. The artificial neural network with adaptive behavior exploited for language learning (ANNABELL) model, is a large-scale neural network, however, unlike most deep learning methods that solve natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it does not represent an empirical engineering solution for specific NLP problems; rather, its organization complies with findings from cognitive neuroscience, particularly the multicompartment working memory models. The system is appropriately trained to understand the level of cognitive development required for language acquisition and the robustness achieved in learning simultaneously four languages, using a corpus of text-based exchanges of developmental complexity. The selected languages, Greek, Italian and Albanian, besides English, differ significantly in structure and complexity. Initially, the system was validated in each language alone and was then compared with the open-ended cumulative training, in which languages are learned jointly, prior to querying with random language at random order. We aimed to assess if the model could learn the languages together to the same degree of skill as learning each apart. Moreover, we explored the generalization skill in multilingual context questions and the ability to elaborate a short text of preschool literature. We verified if the system could follow a dialogue coherently and cohesively, keeping track of its previous answers and recalling them in subsequent queries. The results show that the architecture developed broad language processing functionalities, with satisfactory performances in each language trained singularly, maintaining high accuracies when they are acquired cumulatively.";IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems;1/12/2021;2021;https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2020.3033963;Ioanna Giorgi, Bruno Golosio, Massimo Esposito, Angelo Cangelosi, Giovanni Luca Masala;4;6;Scopus, Semantic Scholar;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Greek+Natural+Language+Processing;26/11/2022;Journal;Article, 'JournalArticle';Multilingual Language Learning;Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP;['Computer Science'];[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}];cognitive system, multilingual system, natural language understanding, neural network;Modern Greek, Albanian, Italian, English;2

205;Emotion Detection On Greek Social Media Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers;"""©"" 2021 ACM.The widespread proliferation of online social networks has resulted in the creation of huge amounts of data related to, among other things, the expression of opinion and sentiment about literally all aspects of everyday life. In this respect, various tools have been developed by interested parties (companies, individuals) that monitor the social media pulse with respect to various topics (products, persons, organizations, etc) in order to detect the stance, either positive or negative, and the overall emotion in the textual content of social media posts and comments. Despite the success of machine learning models for related tasks in popular languages (e.g. English), little progress has been made in under-represented languages, such as Greek. Based on this reality, in this work, we capitalize on the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architectures for emotion detection in social media textual content written in the Greek language. For this purpose, a relevant corpus is initially collected and annotated. Then, two pre-trained BERT models for the Greek language are employed, one of which has been proposed by the authors of the current work in previous publications. Both models are further trained on the collected corpus and are subsequently used in architectures that classify short social media texts in one or more emotion classes. The obtained results indicate that the BERT-based models outperform other approaches, especially those based on emotion lexicons.";ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;26/11/2021;2021;https://doi.org/10.1145/3503823.3503829;Georgios Alexandridis, Konstantinos Korovesis, Iraklis Varlamis, Panagiotis Tsantilas, George Caridakis;0;2;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Conference Proceeding;Conference Paper;Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;;sentiment analysis, emotion detection, bidirection encoder representations from transformers, natural language processing, online social media;Modern Greek;2

We perform our analysis on datasets carefully designed to reflect different sense distributions, and control for parameters that are highly correlated with polysemy such as frequency and grammatical category. We demonstrate that BERT-derived representations reflect words’ polysemy level and their partitionability into senses. Polysemy-related information is more clearly present in English BERT embeddings, but models in other languages also manage to establish relevant distinctions between words at different polysemy levels.

215;A Survey On Sentiment Analysis And Opinion Mining In Greek Social Media;"""©"" 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As the amount of content that is created on social media is constantly increasing, more and more opinions and sentiments are expressed by people in various subjects. In this respect, sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques can be valuable for the automatic analysis of huge textual corpora (comments, reviews, tweets etc.). Despite the advances in text mining algorithms, deep learning techniques, and text representation models, the results in such tasks are very good for only a few high-density languages (e.g., English) that possess large training corpora and rich linguistic resources; nevertheless, there is still room for improvement for the other lower-density languages as well. In this direction, the current work employs various language models for representing social media texts and text classifiers in the Greek language, for detecting the polarity of opinions expressed on social media. The experimental results on a related dataset collected by the authors of the current work are promising, since various classifiers based on the language models (naive bayesian, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, deep feed-forward neural networks) outperform those of word or sentence-based embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), achieving a classification accuracy of more than 80%. Additionally, a new language model for Greek social media has also been trained on the aforementioned dataset, proving that language models based on domain specific corpora can improve the performance of generic language models by a margin of 2%.

237;Innovatively Fused Deep Learning With Limited Noisy Data For Evaluating Translations From Poor Into Rich Morphology;Evaluation of machine translation (MT) into morphologically rich languages has not been well studied despite its importance. This paper proposes a classifier, that is, a deep learning (DL) schema for MT evaluation, based on different categories of information (linguistic features, natural language processing (NLP) metrics and embeddings), by using a model for machine learning based on noisy and small datasets. The linguistic features are string based for the language pairs English (EN)–Greek (EL) and EN–Italian (IT). The paper also explores the linguistic differences that affect evaluation accuracy between different kinds of corpora. A comparative study between using a simple embedding layer (mathematically calculated) and pre-trained embeddings is conducted. Moreover, an analysis of the impact of feature selection and dimensionality reduction on classification accuracy has been conducted. Results show that using a neural network (NN) model with different input representations produces results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art for MT evaluation for EN–EL and EN–IT, by an increase of almost 0.40 points in correlation with human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation. It is observed that the proposed algorithm achieved better results on noisy and small datasets. In addition, for a more integrated analysis of the accuracy results, a qualitative linguistic analysis has been carried out in order to address complex linguistic phenomena.;Applied Sciences;11/1/2021 0:00;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce96c313aef18995428b85bc72245bb76afdf93f;Despoina Mouratidis, Katia Lida Kermanidis, Vilelmini Sosoni;2;2;Semantic Scholar;Greek+Natural+Language+Processing;26/11/2022;;;Machine Translation Evaluation;Machine Translation;['Computer Science'];[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}];"machine learning; deep learning; machine translation; pairwise evaluation; educational data; small datasets; noisy datasets";Modern Greek, English, Italian;2

Conducting experiments with different feature subsets, we show that the different linguistic dimensions contribute orthogonal information, each contributing towards the highest result achieved using all linguistic feature subsets. A readability classifier trained on this basis reaches a classification accuracy of 88.16% for the Greek as a Second Language corpus. To investigate the generalizability of the classification models, we also perform cross-corpus evaluations.

In this paper, we study ethnic bias and how it varies across languages by analyzing and mitigating ethnic bias in monolingual BERT for English, German, Spanish, Korean, Turkish, and Chinese. To observe and quantify ethnic bias, we develop a novel metric called Categorical Bias score. Then we propose two methods for mitigation; first using a multilingual model, and second using contextual word alignment of two monolingual models. We compare our proposed methods with monolingual BERT and show that these methods effectively alleviate the ethnic bias.

We introduce and make publicly available a novel dataset based on Greek legislation, consisting of more than 47 thousand official, categorized Greek legislation resources. We experiment with this dataset and evaluate a battery of advanced methods and classifiers, ranging from traditional machine learning and RNN-based methods to state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods. We show that recurrent architectures with domain-specific word embeddings offer improved overall performance while being competitive even to transformer-based models. Finally, we show that cutting-edge multilingual and monolingual transformer-based models brawl on the top of the classifiers' ranking, making us question the necessity of training monolingual transfer learning models as a rule of thumb.

261;An Evaluation Of Neural Machine Translation And Pre-Trained Word Embeddings In Multilingual Neural Sentiment Analysis;"""©"" 2020 IEEE.One of the main elements in several application domains, such as policy making, addresses the scope of public opinion analysis. The latter is recently realized through sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing, for identifying and extracting subjective information from raw texts. An additional challenge refers to the exploitation and correlation of data from different languages, in order to analyse sentiments by considering all available information in a holistic way. This paper investigates the impact of Neural Machine Translation in sentiment analysis, based on the translation of text for which neural sentiment analysis in English has been already applied and is applied again on the translated German and Greek texts. The latter is performed through the same Neural Network models that were used in the original language, in order to analyse the differences between the performed neural sentiment analysis on the source and the target languages. The outcomes of the proposed approach have a twofold interpretation. While, it is concluded that modern Neural Machine Translation tools are mature enough to provide high accuracy translations and have minor impact on multilingual sentiment analysis, on the other hand it is shown that additional research should be performed on the multilingualism that pre-trained Word Embeddings can provide.";Proceedings of 2020 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing, PIC 2020;18/12/2020;2020;https://doi.org/10.1109/PIC50277.2020.9350849;George Manias, Argyro Mavrogiorgou, Athanasios Kiourtis, Dimosthenis Kyriazis;2;4;Scopus, Semantic Scholar;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Greek+Natural+Language+Processing;26/11/2022;Conference Proceeding;Conference Paper, 'Conference';Document-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}];neural sentiment analysis, neural machine translation, deep learning, word embeddings (key words);Modern Greek, German;2
262;A Graph Neural Network For Assessing The Affective Coherence Of Twitter Graphs;"""©"" 2020 IEEE.Graph neural networks (GNNs) is an emerging class of iterative connectionist models taking full advantage of the interaction patterns in an underlying domain. Depending on their configuration GNNs aggregate local state information to obtain robust estimates of global properties. Since graphs inherently represent high dimensional data, GNNs can effectively perform dimensionality reduction for certain aggregator selections. One such task is assigning sentiment polarity labels to the vertices of a large social network based on local ground truth state vectors containing structural, functional, and affective attributes. Emotions have been long identified as key factors in the overall social network resiliency and determining such labels robustly would be a major indicator of it. As a concrete example, the proposed methodology has been applied to two benchmark graphs obtained from political Twitter with topic sampling regarding the Greek 1821 Independence Revolution and the US 2020 Presidential Elections.

Although there is extensive research in identifying textual offensive language from online content, the dynamic discourse of social media content, as well as the emergence of new forms of offensive language, especially in a multilingual setting, calls for future research in the issue. In this work, we tackled Task A, B, and C of Offensive Language Challenge at SemEval2020. We handled offensive language in five languages: English, Greek, Danish, Arabic, and Turkish. Specifically, we pre-processed all provided datasets and developed an appropriate strategy to handle Tasks (A, B, ""&"" C) for identifying the presence/absence, type and the target of offensive language in social media. For this purpose, we used OLID2019, OLID2020 datasets, and generated new datasets, which we made publicly available. We used the provided unsupervised machine learning implementation for automated annotated datasets and the online Google translation tools to create new datasets as well. We discussed the limitations and the success of our machine learning-based approach for all the five different languages. Our results for identifying offensive posts (Task A) yielded satisfactory accuracy of 0.92 for English, 0.81 for Danish, 0.84 for Turkish, 0.85 for Greek, and 0.89 for Arabic. For the type detection (Task B), the results are significantly higher (.87 accuracy) compared to target detection (Task C), which yields .81 accuracy.

The key question is whether individual learners that bully in their physical learning community (PLC) can be able to exhibit a behavior modification, if integrated in a VLC. Results indicate that the attempted ""integration"" could be a promising framework to behavior modification via a virtual community. Furthermore, machine learning is employed for the automatic detection of aggressive behavior that can facilitate the timely teacher's intervention, without him having to manually scan through the textual dataset.

304;Sentiment Analysis Of Teachers Using Social Information In Educational Platform Environments;"""©"" 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.Learners' opinions constitute an important source of information that can be useful to teachers and educational instructors in order to improve learning procedures and training activities. By analyzing learners' actions and extracting data related to their learning behavior, educators can specify proper learning approaches to stimulate learners' interest and contribute to constructive monitoring of learning progress during the course or to improve future courses. Learners-generated content and their feedback and comments can provide indicative information about the educational procedures that they attended and the training activities that they participated in. Educational systems must possess mechanisms to analyze learners' comments and automatically specify their opinions and attitude towards the courses and the learning activities that are offered to them. This paper describes a Greek language sentiment analysis system that analyzes texts written in Greek language and generates feature vectors which together with classification algorithms give us the opportunity to classify Greek texts based on the personal opinion and the degree of satisfaction expressed. The sentiment analysis module has been integrated into the hybrid educational systems of the Greek school network that offers life-long learning courses. The module offers a wide range of possibilities to lecturers, policymakers and educational institutes that participate in the training procedure and offers life-long learning courses, to understand how their learners perceive learning activities and specify what aspects of the learning activities they liked and disliked.

All rights reserved.In this paper we present our submission to subtask A at SemEval 2020 Task 12: Multilingual Offensive Language Identification in Social Media (OffensEval2). For Danish, Turkish, Arabic and Greek, we develop an architecture based on transfer learning and relying on a two-channel BERT model, in which the English BERT and the multilingual one are combined after creating a machine-translated parallel corpus for each language in the task.

We find that, in a multilingual scenario, with some languages having small training data, using parallel BERT models with machine translated data can give systems more stability, especially when dealing with noisy data.

319;Frame Semantics In The Specialized Domain Of Finance: Building A Termbase To Aid Translation;"""©"" 2020, European Association for Lexicography. All rights reserved.Frame semantics (Fillmore 1977, 1982, 1985) is one of the most important developments for lexicography in the 20th century. The semantic frames approach to lexicon building and semantic representation of meaning at word and phrase level - or even beyond - has been the focus of research in computational linguistics and in Natural Language Processing. The present paper is aimed at describing completed work for the creation of a domain-specific frame-semantic lexicon in Greek (EL) and its alignment to the English (EN) FrameNet. Building on Fillmore’s Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1977, 1982, 1985) and on the example set by the FrameNet project (Baker et al. 1998), we developed a bilingual EL-EN lexical resource in the financial domain based on corpus evidence. Our motivation was two-fold: (a) to better account for the semantics of the specialized lexicon - especially the verbs and predicative nouns of the financial domain, and (b) to make cross-lingual alignments at the word level in a way that is meaningful for the translation process.";EURALEX Proceedings;1/1/2020;2021;https://euralex2020.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURALEX2020_ProceedingsBook-p263-271.pdf;V.

322;Hybrid Data Driven And Rule Based Sentiment Analysis On Greek Text;"""©"" 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.Sentiment analysis is a developing field dealing with the detection of sentiments or opinions expressed in a written text. In an age where online services are subject to immediate feedback by users and clients, sentiment analysis on bodies of online reviews is of particular interest to service-oriented businesses such as hospitality establishments. Methods based on Machine Learning are very widely used for this purpose. While some standardized methodologies exist, the sheer volume of data on which the analysis is to be performed in order to train a Deep Learning network, makes it important to come up with designs that are sufficiently complex so as to accurately detect sentiment but also simple enough so as to be scalable and efficient in terms of performance. In this paper, we examine trade-offs of accuracy versus efficiency by performing sentiment analysis on an annotated body of review texts collected from online hotel reserving resources. The reviews we use to train our Deep Learning models are pre-processed by a tool which uses linguistic rules to add sentiment tags to words and expressions in the text. The tags express sentiment polarity, i.e. whether the expression is positive or negative. We propose four different DL network designs, which receive as training input either the review texts, the review texts plus some information on the tag annotation, or the annotation of the text alone, and we present the trade-offs that each setup offers.";Procedia Computer Science;1/1/2020;2020;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.11.025;Angela Braoudaki, Eleni Kanellou, Christos Kozanitis, Panagiota Fatourou;2;5;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Conference Proceeding;Conference Paper;Document-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;;"machine learning; deep learning; sentiment analysis";Modern Greek;2

374;Xlda: Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation For Natural Language Inference And Question Answering;While natural language processing systems often focus on a single language, multilingual transfer learning has the potential to improve performance, especially for low-resource languages. We introduce XLDA, cross-lingual data augmentation, a method that replaces a segment of the input text with its translation in another language. XLDA enhances performance of all 14 tested languages of the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark. With improvements of up to $4.8\%$, training with XLDA achieves state-of-the-art performance for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. XLDA is in contrast to, and performs markedly better than, a more naive approach that aggregates examples in various languages in a way that each example is solely in one language. On the SQuAD question answering task, we see that XLDA provides a $1.0\%$ performance increase on the English evaluation set.

382;Neural Embeddings For Metaphor Detection In A Corpus Of Greek Texts;"""©"" 2018 IEEEOne of the major challenges that NLP faces is metaphor detection, especially by automatic means, a task that becomes even more difficult for languages lacking in linguistic resources and tools. Our purpose is the automatic differentiation between literal and metaphorical meaning in authentic non-annotated phrases from the Corpus of Greek Texts by means of computational methods of machine learning. For this purpose the theoretical background of distributional semantics is discussed and employed. Distributional Semantics Theory develops concepts and methods for the quantification and classification of semantic similarities displayed by linguistic elements in large amounts of linguistic data according to their distributional properties. In accordance with this model, the approach followed in the current work takes into account the linguistic context for the computation of the distributional representation of phrases in geometrical space, as well as for their comparison with the distributional representations of other phrases, whose function in speech is already ""known"" with the objective to reach conclusions about their literal or metaphorical function in the specific linguistic context. This procedure aims at dealing with the lack of linguistic resources for the Greek language, as the almost impossible up to now semantic comparison between ""phrases"", takes the form of an arithmetical comparison of their distributional representations in geometrical space.";2018 9th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, IISA 2018;1/2/2019;2018;https://doi.org/10.1109/IISA.2018.8633668;Eirini Florou, Konstantinos A.

383;A Comparative Assessment Of The Difficulty Of Authorship Attribution In Greek And In English;"""©"" 2018 ASIS""&""TAuthorship attribution is an important problem in text classification, with many applications and a substantial body of research activity. Among the research findings are that many different methods will work, including a number of methods that are superficially language-independent (such as an analysis of the most common “words” or “character n-grams” in a document). Since all languages have words (and all written languages have characters), this method could (in theory) work on any language. However, it is not clear that the methods that work best on, for example English, would also work best on other languages. It is not even clear that the same level of performance is achievable in different languages, even under identical conditions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve “identical conditions” in practice. A new corpus, developed by George Mikros, provides very tight controls not only for author but also for topic, thus enabling a direct comparison of performance levels between the two languages Greek and English. We compare a number of different methods head-to-head on this corpus, and show that, overall, performance on English is higher than performance on Greek, often highly significantly so.";Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology;1/1/2019;2019;https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24073;Patrick Juola, George K.

387;Ensemble And Deep Learning For Language-Independent Automatic Selection Of Parallel Data;"""©"" 2018 by the authors.Machine translation is used in many applications in everyday life. Due to the increase of translated documents that need to be organized as useful or not (for building a translation model), the automated categorization of texts (classification), is a popular research field of machine learning. This kind of information can be quite helpful for machine translation. Our parallel corpora (English-Greek and English-Italian) are based on educational data, which are quite difficult to translate. We apply two state of the art architectures, Random Forest (RF) and Deeplearnig4j (DL4J), to our data (which constitute three translation outputs). To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning architectures are applied to the automatic selection of parallel data. We also propose new string-based features that seem to be effective for the classifier, and we investigate whether an attribute selection method could be used for better classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate an increase of up to 4% (compared to our previous work) using RF and rather satisfactory results using DL4J.";Algorithms;1/1/2019;2019;https://doi.org/10.3390/a12010026;Despoina Mouratidis, Katia Lida Kermanidis;4;7;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Machine Translation Evaluation;Machine Translation;;;"machine learning; deep learning; education data; data selection; machine translation; DL4J deep learning architecture; random forest";Modern Greek, English, Italian;2

402;Building And Evaluating Resources For Sentiment Analysis In The Greek Language;"""©"" 2018, The Author(s).Sentiment lexicons and word embeddings constitute well-established sources of information for sentiment analysis in online social media. Although their effectiveness has been demonstrated in state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and related tasks in the English language, such publicly available resources are much less developed and evaluated for the Greek language. In this paper, we tackle the problems arising when analyzing text in such an under-resourced language. We present and make publicly available a rich set of such resources, ranging from a manually annotated lexicon, to semi-supervised word embedding vectors and annotated datasets for different tasks. Our experiments using different algorithms and parameters on our resources show promising results over standard baselines; on average, we achieve a 24.9% relative improvement in F-score on the cross-domain sentiment analysis task when training the same algorithms with our resources, compared to training them on more traditional feature sources, such as n-grams.

404;Detecting Hate Speech Within The Terrorist Argument: A Greek Case;"""©"" 2018 IEEE.This paper presents a methodology for automatically detecting the presence of hate speech within the terrorist argument. Hate speech can be used by a terrorist group as a means of judging possible targets' guilt and deciding on their punishment, as well as a means of making people to accept acts of terror or even as propaganda for possibly attracting new members. In this paper, we examine both ideology expressed and practices employed by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November (hereafter 17N) that operated in Greece between the years of 1975 and 2002. Within this line of thought, we will focus on the ideological justification, ethical standing and deployment of the terrorist operations as presented in the communiqu?s published by 17N, emphasizing on the use of hate speech as a means of justifying their choices and actions, as well as a way of reaching out to Greek people. To decide on how the automatic classification will be performed, we experimented with different text analyzing techniques such as critical discourse and content analysis and based on the preliminary results of these techniques a classification algorithm is proposed that can classify the communiqu?s in three categories depending on the presence of hate speech. The methodology was tested over the existing dataset with all the communiqu?s and the corresponding results are discussed.";Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2018;24/10/2018;2018;https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508270;Ioanna K.

405;Nowcasting The Stance Of Social Media Users In A Sudden Vote: The Case Of The Greek Referendum;"""©"" 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.Modelling user voting intention in social media is an important research area, with applications in analysing electorate behaviour, online political campaigning and advertising. Previous approaches mainly focus on predicting national general elections, which are regularly scheduled and where data of past results and opinion polls are available. However, there is no evidence of how such models would perform during a sudden vote under time-constrained circumstances. That poses a more challenging task compared to traditional elections, due to its spontaneous nature. In this paper, we focus on the 2015 Greek bailout referendum, aiming to nowcast on a daily basis the voting intention of 2,197 Twitter users. We propose a semi-supervised multiple convolution kernel learning approach, leveraging temporally sensitive text and network information.

406;Do Deep Networks Really Need Complex Modules For Multilingual Sentiment Polarity Detection And Domain Classification?;"""©"" 2018 IEEE.In this article we introduce an empirical study of multilingual and multi-topic opinion classification. The particularity relies on the reviews that are written in different languages and refer to different but semantically close topics: Restaurants and Hotels. Our key objective is to emphasize the ability of a deep learning model to establish the sentiment polarity of reviews and topics Classification in a multilingual environment without any prior knowledge. For this work, we use unstructured text data, collected from the web, written in French, English and Greek (a less opinion-present language). The incorporate corpus-based input is raw, used without any pre-processing, translation, annotation nor additional knowledge features. For the machine learning approach, we use two different deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CONVNETS) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The learning model exploits n-gram level information, and achieves high accuracy for sentiment polarity and topics classification according to the experimental tests and results. From our hypothesis, we argue that the multilingual environment composed of reviews in semantically close domains, does not impact the network performance, and lead us to deduce that semantic features extraction with ConvNets and RNNs are language and context independent. Following these results, we tend to promote the inception of simple yet powerful approach for feeding deep networks in multilingual context.";Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks;10/10/2018;2018;https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489613;Lisa Medrouk, Anna Pappa;3;10;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Conference Proceeding;Conference Paper;Document-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;;Deep Learning, Multi-Domain Classification, Multilingual Classification, Opinion Analysis, ConvNets, LSTM, Raw Text Corpus;Modern Greek, English, French;2

414;Assessing Internal Audit With Text Mining;"""©"" 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.Recently internal controls, corporate governance and risk management have received a great deal of attention. Regarding internal control, several research studies address the issue of internal audit quality. Noteworthy, according to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) the internal controls over financial reporting are assessed by the auditors and the management. In the present study, we assess internal controls over financial reporting by employing Text Mining techniques. We analyse the annual reports of 133 publicly traded Greek Companies. The textual parts of the annual reports that refer to internal audit mechanism are extracted. We adopt a Vector Space model and the term-document matrix records the occurrence frequencies of the terms. By applying feature selection, a set of significant keywords, which are used as predictors, is extracted. The Linear Regression model developed explains the variance of the data and highlights significant predictors. The model manages to successfully assess the internal audit function. By performing PCA, major underlying procedures and concepts related to internal audit quality are revealed. Inspite of the undoubted importance of the assessment of internal audit, no previous attempt has been made to assess internal audit and to extract internal audit information from corporate disclosures by using Text Mining techniques. Our results can be useful to internal and external auditors, managers, company decision-makers, regulators and researchers.";Journal of Information and Knowledge Management;1/6/2018;2018;https://doi.org/10.1142/S021964921850020X;Georgia Boskou, Efstathios Kirkos, Charalambos Spathis;3;15;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Business NLP;NLP applications;;;Internal auditi, nternal control, internal audit quality, text mining, financial statements;Modern Greek;2

460;Investigating The Complete Corpus Of Referendum And Elections Tweets;"""©"" 2016 IEEE.Today, a considerable proportion of the public political discourse that proceeds nationwide elections is happening through Online Social Networks. Through analyzing this content, we can discover the major themes that prevailed during the discussion, investigate the temporal variation of positive and negative sentiment and examine the semantic proximity of these themes. According to existing studies, the results of similar tasks are heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of dictionaries for linguistic preprocessing, entity discovery and sentiment analysis. Additionally, noise reduction is achieved with methods for sarcasm detection and correction. Here we report on the application of these methods on the complete corpus of tweets regarding two local electoral events of worldwide impact: the Greek referendum of 2015 and the subsequent legislative elections. To this end, we compiled novel dictionaries for sentiment and entity detection for the Greek language tailored to these events. We subsequently performed volume analysis, sentiment analysis and sarcasm correction. Results showed that there was a strong anti-austerity sentiment accompanied with a critical view on European and Greek political actions.";Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2016;21/11/2016;2016;https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752220;Despoina Antonakaki, Dimitris Spiliotopoulos, Christos V.

471;A Comparison Between Semi-Supervised And Supervised Text Mining Techniques On Detecting Irony In Greek Political Tweets;"""©"" 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The present work describes a classification schema for irony detection in Greek political tweets. Our hypothesis states that humorous political tweets could predict actual election results. The irony detection concept is based on subjective perceptions, so only relying on human-annotator driven labor might not be the best route. The proposed approach relies on limited labeled training data, thus a semi-supervised approach is followed, where collective-learning algorithms take both labeled and unlabeled data into consideration. We compare the semi-supervised results with the supervised ones from a previous research of ours. The hypothesis is evaluated via a correlation study between the irony that a party receives on Twitter, its respective actual election results during the Greek parliamentary elections of May 2012, and the difference between these results and the ones of the preceding elections of 2009.";Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;1/5/2016;2016;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2016.01.007;Basilis Charalampakis, Dimitris Spathis, Elias Kouslis, Katia Lida Kermanidis;41;60;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis;Sentiment Analysis and Argument Mining;;;n/a;Modern Greek;2
473;Authorship Verification For Different Languages, Genres And Topics;"""©"" 2016 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Ltd.Authorship verification is a branch of forensic authorship analysis addressing the following task: Given a number of sample documents of an author A and a document allegedly written by A, the task is to decide whether the author of the latter document is truly A or not. We present a scalable authorship verification method that copes with this problem across different languages, genres and topics. The central concept of our method is a model, which is trained with Dutch, English, Greek, Spanish and German text documents. The model sets for each language specific parameters and a threshold that accepts or rejects the alleged author as A. The proposed method offers a wide range of benefits, e.g., a universal (static) threshold for each language and scalability regarding almost any involved component (classification function, ensemble strategy, features, etc.). Furthermore, the method benefits from low runtime due to the fact that no natural language processing techniques nor other computationally-intensive methods are involved. In our experiments, we applied the method on 28 test corpora including 4525 verification cases across 16 genres and a huge number of mixed topics, where we achieved competitive results (75% median accuracy).

It contains human ratings for the three continuous affective dimensions of valence, arousal and dominance for 1034 words. The Greek affective lexicon is compared with affective lexica in English, Spanish and Portuguese. The lexicon is automatically expanded by selecting a small number of manually annotated words to bootstrap the process of estimating affective ratings of unknown words. We experimented with the parameters of the semantic-affective model in order to investigate their impact to its performance, which reaches 85% binary classification accuracy (positive vs. negative ratings).

497;Multilingual Event Extraction For Epidemic Detection;"""©"" 2015 Elsevier B.V.Objective: This paper presents a multilingual news surveillance system applied to tele-epidemiology. It has been shown that multilingual approaches improve timeliness in detection of epidemic events across the globe, eliminating the wait for local news to be translated into major languages. We present here a system to extract epidemic events in potentially any language, provided a Wikipedia seed for common disease names exists. Methods: The Daniel system presented herein relies on properties that are common to news writing (the journalistic genre), the most useful being repetition and saliency. Wikipedia is used to screen common disease names to be matched with repeated characters strings. Language variations, such as declensions, are handled by processing text at the character-level, rather than at the word level. This additionally makes it possible to handle various writing systems in a similar fashion. Material: As no multilingual ground truth existed to evaluate the Daniel system, we built a multilingual corpus from the Web, and collected annotations from native speakers of Chinese, English, Greek, Polish and Russian, with no connection or interest in the Daniel system. This data set is available online freely, and can be used for the evaluation of other event extraction systems. Results: Experiments for 5 languages out of 17 tested are detailed in this paper: Chinese, English, Greek, Polish and Russian. The Daniel system achieves an average F-measure of 82% in these 5 languages. It reaches 87% on BE. corpus, the state-of-the-art corpus in English, slightly below top-performing systems, which are tailored with numerous language-specific resources. The consistent performance of Daniel on multiple languages is an important contribution to the reactivity and the coverage of epidemiological event detection systems. Conclusions: Most event extraction systems rely on extensive resources that are language-specific. While their sophistication induces excellent results (over 90% precision and recall), it restricts their coverage in terms of languages and geographic areas. In contrast, in order to detect epidemic events in any language, the Daniel system only requires a list of a few hundreds of disease names and locations, which can actually be acquired automatically. The system can perform consistently well on any language, with precision and recall around 82% on average, according to this paper's evaluation. Daniel's character-based approach is especially interesting for morphologically-rich and low-resourced languages. The lack of resources to be exploited and the state of the art string matching algorithms imply that Daniel can process thousands of documents per minute on a simple laptop. In the context of epidemic surveillance, reactivity and geographic coverage are of primary importance, since no one knows where the next event will strike, and therefore in what vernacular language it will first be reporteDBy being able to process any language, the Daniel system offers unique coverage for poorly endowed languages, and can complete state of the art techniques for major languages.";Artificial Intelligence in Medicine;1/10/2015;2015;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2015.06.005;Ga?l Lejeune, Romain P.

503;A Cross-Lingual Similarity Measure For Detecting Biomedical Term Translations;"""©"" 2015 Bollegala et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Bilingual dictionaries for technical terms such as biomedical terms are an important resource for machine translation systems as well as for humans who would like to understand a concept described in a foreign language. Often a biomedical term is first proposed in English and later it is manually translated to other languages. Despite the fact that there are large monolingual lexicons of biomedical terms, only a fraction of those term lexicons are translated to other languages. Manually compiling large-scale bilingual dictionaries for technical domains is a challenging task because it is difficult to find a sufficiently large number of bilingual experts. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure for detecting most similar translation candidates for a biomedical term specified in one language (source) from another language (target). Specifically, a biomedical term in a language is represented using two types of features: (a) intrinsic features that consist of character n-grams extracted from the term under consideration, and (b) extrinsic features that consist of unigrams and bigrams extracted from the contextual windows surrounding the term under consideration. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure using each of those feature types. First, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space in each language, we propose prototype vector projection (PVP) - a non-negative lower-dimensional vector projection method. Second, we propose a method to learn a mapping between the feature spaces in the source and target language using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The proposed method requires only a small number of training instances to learn a cross-lingual similarity measure. The proposed PVP method outperforms popular dimensionality reduction methods such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a nearest neighbor prediction task. Moreover, our experimental results covering several language pairs such as English-French, English-Spanish, English-Greek, and English-Japanese show that the proposed method outperforms several other feature projection methods in biomedical term translation prediction tasks.";PLoS ONE;1/6/2015;2015;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126196;Danushka Tarupathi Bollegala, Georgios Kontonatsios, Sophia Ananiadou;6;14;Scopus;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011;26/11/2022;Journal;Article;Term Translations Detection;Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP;;;n/a;Modern Greek, English, French, Spanish, Japanese;2

515;Argument Extraction From News;"""©"" 2015 Association for Computational LinguisticsArgument extraction is the task of identifying arguments, along with their components in text. Arguments can be usually decomposed into a claim and one or more premises justifying it. The proposed approach tries to identify segments that represent argument elements (claims and premises) on social Web texts (mainly news and blogs) in the Greek language, for a small set of thematic domains, including articles on politics, economics, culture, various social issues, and sports. The proposed approach exploits distributed representations of words, extracted from a large non-annotated corpus. Among the novel aspects of this work is the thematic domain itself which relates to social Web, in contrast to traditional research in the area, which concentrates mainly on law documents and scientific publications. The huge increase of social web communities, along with their user tendency to debate, makes the identification of arguments in these texts a necessity. In addition, a new manually annotated corpus has been constructed that can be used freely for research purposes.

Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous contextfree grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this paper explores extending translation rules with high quality and increased coverage in three ways. First, we introduce structure informed non-terminals, better guiding the parsing in favor of well formed structure, instead of using a uninformed non-terminal in SCFGs. Second, we examine the difference between word alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. Finally, we address the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules.

527;Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Using Emoticons And Keywords;"""©"" 2014 IEEE.Nowadays the World Wide Web has evolved into a leading communication channel and information exchange medium. Especially after the introduction of the so-called web 2.0 and the explosion that followed regarding user generated content, the amount of data available over the internet has attracted the interest of both the scientific and business community. Their efforts focus on identifying the inner structures of data and the knowledge that can be derived by analyzing them. Web 2.0 is the subject of study and research in a number of areas. One of these areas is sentiment analysis, where the main goal is to study and draw conclusions about subjectivity, polarity and the feeling that is expressed in user generated content, which mainly consist of free text documents. The goal of this paper is to apply sentiment analysis on multilingual data, focusing on documents written in Greek. We developed an integrated framework that accepts user generated documents and then identifies the polarity of the text (neutral, negative or positive) and the sentiment expressed through it (joy, love, anger or sadness). We followed a semi-supervised approach which led to the development of two techniques for the automatic collection of training data without any human intervention. Our approach involves the detection and use of self-defining features that are available within the data. We take into account two emotionally rich features: a) emoticons and b) lists of emotionally intense keywords. These features are evaluated on data coming from a popular forum, using various classifiers and feature vectors. Our experimental results point to various conclusions about the effectiveness, advantages and limitations of applying such methods on Greek data. Using keywords we achieved 90[%] mean accuracy on identifying the subjectivity level and 93[%] on correctly identifying the polarity level, whereas using emoticons the mean accuracy for each of these levels was 74[%] and 77[%] respectively.";Proceedings - 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops, WI-IAT 2014;16/10/2014;2014;https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.86;Georgios S.

544;Cross-Language Transfer Of Semantic Annotation Via Targeted Crowdsourcing;"Copyright ""©"" 2014 ISCA.The development of a natural language speech application requires the process of semantic annotation. Moreover multilingual porting of speech applications increases the cost and complexity of the annotation task. In this paper we address the problem of transferring the semantic annotation of the source language corpus to a low-resource target language via crowdsourcing. The current crowdsourcing approach faces several problems. First, the available crowdsourcing platforms have skewed distribution of language speakers. Second, speech applications require domain-specific knowledge. Third, the lack of reference target language annotation, makes crowdsourcing worker control very difficult. In this paper we address these issues on the task of cross-language transfer of domain-specific semantic annotation from an Italian spoken language corpus to Greek, via targeted crowdsourcing. The issue of domain knowledge transfer is addressed by priming the workers with the source language concepts. The lack of reference annotation is coped with a consensus-based annotation algorithm. The quality of annotation transfer is assessed using source language references and inter-annotator agreement. We demonstrate that the proposed computational methodology is viable and achieves acceptable annotation quality.";Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH;1/1/2014;2014;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-017-9396-5;Shammur Absar Chowdhury, Arindam Ghosh, Evgeny A.

548;I Sentenizer-: Multilingual Sentence Boundary Detection Model;"Sentence boundary detection (SBD) system is normally quite sensitive to genres of data that the system is trained on. The genres of data are often referred to the shifts of text topics and new languages domains. Although new detection models can be retrained for different languages or new text genres, previous model has to be thrown away and the creation process has to be restarted from scratch. In this paper, we present a multilingual sentence boundary detection system (iSentenizer-) for Danish, German, English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Finnish, and Swedish languages. The proposed system is able to detect the sentence boundaries of a mixture of different text genres and languages with high accuracy. We employ i +Learning algorithm, an incremental tree learning architecture, for constructing the system. iSentenizer-, under the incremental learning framework, is adaptable to text of different topics and Roman-alphabet languages, by merging new data into existing model to learn the new knowledge incrementally by revision instead of retraining. The system has been extensively evaluated on different languages and text genres and has been compared against two state-of-the-art SBD systems, Punkt and MaxEnt. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the other systems on all datasets. ""©"" 2014 Derek F.

549;Overview Of The Author Identification Task At Pan 2014;The author identification task at PAN-2014 focuses on author verification. Similar to PAN-2013 we are given a set of documents by the same author along with exactly one document of questioned authorship, and the task is to determine whether the known and the questioned documents are by the same author or not. In comparison to PAN-2013, a significantly larger corpus was built comprising hundreds of documents in four natural languages (Dutch, English, Greek, and Spanish) and four genres (essays, reviews, novels, opinion articles). In addition, more suitable performance measures are used focusing on the accuracy and the confidence of the predictions as well as the ability of the submitted methods to leave some problems unanswered in case there is great uncertainty. To this end, we adopt the c@1 measure, originally proposed for the question answering task. We received 13 software submissions that were evaluated in the TIRA framework. Analytical evaluation results are presented where one language-independent approach serves as a challenging baseline. Moreover, we continue the successful practice of the PAN labs to examine meta-models based on the combination of all submitted systems. Last but not least, we provide statistical significance tests to demonstrate the important differences between the submitted approaches.;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;1/1/2014;2014;;Efstathios Stamatatos, Walter Daelemans, Ben Verhoeven, Martin Potthast, Benno Maria Stein, Patrick Juola, Miguel A.

553;Word Semantic Similarity For Morphologically Rich Languages;In this work, we investigate the role of morphology on the performance of semantic similarity for morphologically rich languages, such as German and Greek. The challenge in processing languages with richer morphology than English, lies in reducing estimation error while addressing the semantic distortion introduced by a stemmer or a lemmatiser. For this purpose, we propose a methodology for selective stemming, based on a semantic distortion metric. The proposed algorithm is tested on the task of similarity estimation between words using two types of corpus-based similarity metrics: co-occurrence-based and context-based. The performance on morphologically rich languages is boosted by stemming with the context-based metric, unlike English, where the best results are obtained by the co-occurrence-based metric. A key finding is that the estimation error reduction is different when a word is used as a feature, rather than when it is used as a target word.;Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2014;1/1/2014;2014;http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/973_Paper.pdf;Kalliopi Zervanou, Elias Iosif, Alexandros Potamianos;9;11;Scopus, ACL;TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011, Greek;26/11/2022;Conference Proceeding;Conference Paper;distributional semantic modeling;Semantics:Lexical;;;distributional semantic models, lexical semantics, morphology, morphologically rich languages;Modern Greek, English, German;2
556;Any Language Early Detection Of Epidemic Diseases From Web News Streams;"In this paper, we introduce a multilingual epidemiological news surveillance system. Its main contribution is its ability to extract epidemic events in any language, hence succeeding where state-of-the-art in surveillance systems usually fails: the objective of reactivity. Most systems indeed focus on a selected list of languages, deemed important. However, evidence shows that events are first described in the local language, and translated to other languages later, if and only if they contained important information. Hence, while systems handling only a sample of human languages may indeed succeed at extracting epidemic events, they will only do so after someone else detected the importance of the news, and made the decision to translate it. Thus, with events first described in other languages, such automated systems, that may only detect events that were already detected by humans, are essentially irrelevant for early detection. To overcome this weakness of the state-of-the-art in terms of reactivity, we designed a system that can detect epidemiological events in any language, without requiring any translation, be it automated or human-written. The solution presented in this paper relies on properties that may be called language universals. First, we observe and exploit properties of the news genre that remain unchanged, whatever the writing language. Second, we handle language variations, such as declensions, by processing text at the character-level, rather than at the word level. This additionally allows to handle various writing systems in a similar fashion. We present experiments with 5 languages, steoreotypical of different language families and writing systems: English, Chinese, Greek, Polish and Russian. Our system, DAnIEL, achieves an average F-measure score around 85%, slightly below top-performing systems for the languages that such systems are able to handle. However, its performance is superior for morphologically-rich languages. And it performs of course infinitely better for the languages that other systems are not able to handle: The richest system in the state-of-the-art handles around 10 languages, while there exists about 6,000 languages in the world, 300 of which are spoken by more than one million people. The DAnIEL system is able to process each of them.

560;Text Segmentation For Language Identification In Greek Forums;In this paper, we examine the benefit of applying text segmentation methods to perform ] language identification in forums. The focus here is on forums containing a mixture of information written in Greek, English as well as Greeklish. Greeklish can be defined as the use of Latin alphabet for rendering Greek words with Latin characters. For the evaluation, a corpus was manually created, by collecting web pages from Greek university forums and most specifically, pages containing information that combines Greek with English technical terminology and Greeklish. The evaluation using two well known text segmentation algorithms leads to the conclusion that, despite the difficulty of the problem examined, text segmentation seems to be a promising solution.;Proceedings of the Workshop on Adaptation of Language Resources and Tools for Closely Related Languages and Language Variants;Óåð-13;2014;https://aclanthology.org/W13-5305;Pavlina Fragkou;10;10;ACL;Greek;26/11/2022;;;Language Identification;Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP;;;n/a;Modern Greek, English, Greeklish;2

Thus, cognates are important indicators for the prediction of the perceived difficulty of a text. We introduce a method for automatic cognate production using character-based machine translation. We show that our approach is able to learn production patterns from noisy training data and that it works for a wide range of language pairs. It even works across different alphabets, e.g. we obtain good results on the tested language pairs English-Russian, English-Greek, and English-Farsi.

572;Daniel: Language Independent Character-Based News Surveillance;"This study aims at developing a news surveillance system able to address multilingual web corpora. As an example of a domain where multilingual capacity is crucial, we focus on Epidemic Surveillance. This task necessitates worldwide coverage of news in order to detect new events as quickly as possible, anywhere, whatever the language it is first reported in. In this study, text-genre is used rather than sentence analysis. The news-genre properties allow us to assess the thematic relevance of news, filtered with the help of a specialised lexicon that is automatically collected on Wikipedia. Afterwards, a more detailed analysis of text specific properties is applied to relevant documents to better characterize the epidemic event (i.e., which disease spreads where?). Results from 400 documents in each language demonstrate the interest of this multilingual approach with light resources. DAnIEL achieves an F 1-measure score around 85%. Two issues are addressed: the first is morphology rich languages, e.g. Greek, Polish and Russian as compared to English. The second is event location detection as related to disease detection. This system provides a reliable alternative to the generic IE architecture that is constrained by the lack of numerous components in many languages.

610;Bilingual Question Answering Over Dbpedia Abstracts Through Machine Translation And On Deep Learning For Knowledge Graphs. Tiresias: Bilingual Question Answering Over Dbpedia Abstracts Through Machine Translation And Bert;There is a high need for providing multilingual solutions to Natural Language Processing tasks, such as for Question Answering, since a lot of people do not speak and read English. In this way, DBpedia abstracts, which are offered in several languages, can be exploited, since they cover valuable information which are never transformed to structured data (to triples), whereas for the same entity, the abstract in different languages can contain complementary information. For making it feasible to answer simple open domain factoid questions over DBpedia abstracts, we introduce Tiresias , a research prototype that supports bilingual Question Answering (QA) over DBpedia abstracts. In particular, it receives a question either in Greek or in English language, and by exploiting Named Entity Recognition models for recognizing the entity of the question, the DBpedia abstracts written in the mentioned languages for the identified entity, Machine Translation (MT) tools, and BERT QA models (pretrained in English corpus), it produces the final answer. Concerning the evaluation, we provide experimental results about the effectiveness and efficiency of MT and QA process by using a Greek evaluation collection, and we present statistics of DBpedia abstracts and several use cases with real examples.;;2022;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/017b6d47dae1fdb496f3cb555ec40c908f7da05c;M.

In this paper, we introduce a curated dataset of the Greek Parliament Proceedings that extends chronologically from 1989 up to 2020. It consists of more than 1 million speeches with extensive metadata, extracted from 5,355 parliamentary record files. We explain how it was constructed and the challenges that we had to overcome. The dataset can be used for both computational linguistics and political analysis-ideally, combining the two. We present such an application, showing (i) how the dataset can be used to study the change of word usage through time, (ii) between significant historical events and political parties, (iii) by evaluating and employing algorithms for detecting semantic shifts.;Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems;1/1/2022;2022;;Konstantina Dritsa, Kaiti Thoma, John Pavlopoulos, Panos Louridas;1;2;Google Scholar;;21/2/2024;;;Corpus Creation, Lexical Semantics;"Resources and Evaluation; Semantics:Lexical";;;n/a;Modern Greek;2
731;Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer For Clinical Phenotyping;Clinical phenotyping enables the automatic extraction of clinical conditions from patient records, which can be beneficial to doctors and clinics worldwide. However, current state-of-the-art models are mostly applicable to clinical notes written in English. We therefore investigate cross-lingual knowledge transfer strategies to execute this task for clinics that do not use the English language and have a small amount of in-domain data available. We evaluate these strategies for a Greek and a Spanish clinic leveraging clinical notes from different clinical domains such as cardiology, oncology and the ICU. Our results reveal two strategies that outperform the state-of-the-art: Translation-based methods in combination with domain-specific encoders and cross-lingual encoders plus adapters. We find that these strategies perform especially well for classifying rare phenotypes and we advise on which method to prefer in which situation. Our results show that using multilingual data overall improves clinical phenotyping models and can compensate for data sparseness.;2022 Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, LREC 2022;1/1/2022;2022;;Jens Michalis Papaioannou, Paul Grundmann, Betty van Aken, Athanasios Samaras, Ilias Kyparissidis, George A.

735;Translating Law: A Comparison Of Human And Post-Edited Translations From Greek To English;"Advances in neural machine translation (NMT) models have led to reported improvements in machine translation (MT) outputs, especially for resource-rich language pairs (Deng ""&"" Liu, 2018), mainly at the level of fluency (Castilho et al., 2017a, 2017b). NMT systems have been used particularly for the translation of technical and life science texts with short, repetitive, formulaic, and unambiguous sentence types. In contrast, legal translation studies scholars have depicted legal translation as not particularly compatible with MT, mainly because legal texts include features that pose significant challenges to MT (Killman, 2014; Prieto Ramos, 2015; Matthiesen, 2017). As such, the quality of the output varies according to the legal genre and language pair. Using MQM-DQF error typology, this study evaluates the quality of the post-edited and human translation (HT) products of two normative property law texts from Greek to English, a language pair considered to be under-resourced. The time taken by the two translators who participated in the study to complete these products was monitored, and information was collected on their attitudes towards MT and post-editing (PE). The findings indicate neither productivity gains in the case of PE, nor major differences in accuracy or fluency between the post-edited and HT texts, although the number of errors was slightly higher overall in the case of HT, with most occurring at the level of accuracy. Conversely, the post-edited versions contained more errors at the levels of style and verity. Finally, the translators' views on MT and PE were dependent on the MT output quality, while their trust level in the output may have affected the end-product quality.";Revista de Llengua i Dret;1/12/2022;2022;;Vilelmini Sosoni, John O'Shea, Maria Stasimioti;1;5;Google Scholar;;21/2/2024;;;Machine Translation Evaluation;Machine Translation;;;missing;Modern Greek, English;2
